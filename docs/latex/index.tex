 This is a command-\/line program that can be used to demonstrate system calls in UNIX. It is written in C and uses the GNU C Library and the POSIX API.

This project was done as a part of the Advanced Operating Systems (MCSC202) course at the University of Delhi.

Function references are available online at \href{https://syscalls-cli.ghosh.pro/html/files.html}{\texttt{ https\+://syscalls-\/cli.\+ghosh.\+pro/html/files.\+html}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This program supports the following features as of now\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item creating a file/named pipe with permissions as given by user
\item reading from a file and printing the contents to {\ttfamily stdout}
\item writing to a file from {\ttfamily stdin}
\item displaying statistical information about a file
\item copying the contents of one file to another using an unnamed pipe
\item using a named pipe to communicate between two processes
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Note}\+: The reading and writing operations also support offsets and number of bytes to be read or written.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Commands}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The various commands supported by this program can be listed by running the program without any arguments.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main}
\DoxyCodeLine{Usage:\ ./main\ [command]\ [options...]\ [file1]\ [file2...]}
\DoxyCodeLine{Commands:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ create:\ create\ a\ file\ or\ a\ named\ pipe}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ read:\ read\ a\ file\ and\ print\ to\ stdout}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ write:\ write\ to\ a\ file}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ copy:\ copy\ a\ file\ using\ an\ unnamed\ pipe}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ info:\ information\ about\ a\ file}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ pipe:\ create\ a\ pipe\ and\ simulate\ communication\ between\ processes}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Each command has its own set of options and arguments. The usage of each commmand can be known by executing {\ttfamily ./main \mbox{[}command\mbox{]}}. The details of each command are given below.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Creating Files}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The {\ttfamily create} command should be used to create a file or a named pipe. The permissions of the file or named pipe have to be specified after the path as an octal number. The {\ttfamily -\/p} flag can be used to create a named pipe.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Creating a Regular File}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ create\ file.txt\ 0644}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Creating a Named Pipe}\label{index_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ create\ -\/p\ pipe\ 0666}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape Note}\+: In case the file or named pipe already exists, the program will exit with an error asking the user to pass the {\ttfamily -\/f} flag if they really want to do so.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Reading Files}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
The {\ttfamily read} command should be used to read a file and print its contents to {\ttfamily stdout} i.\+e. the console. The {\ttfamily -\/o} flag can be used to specify the offset from which the file should be read. The {\ttfamily -\/n} flag can be used to specify the number of bytes to be read from the file. If the {\ttfamily -\/n} flag is not used, the entire file will be read. If the {\ttfamily -\/o} flag is not used, the file will be read from the beginning.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Reading a File}\label{index_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ read\ file.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{lorem\ ipsum\ dolor\ amet}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Reading a File (\+With Offset and Number of Bytes)}\label{index_autotoc_md9}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ read\ file.txt\ -\/o\ 6\ -\/n\ 5}
\DoxyCodeLine{ipsum}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Writing to Files}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
The {\ttfamily write} command should be used to write to a file from {\ttfamily stdin} -\/ the console or a shell pipe. The {\ttfamily -\/o} flag can be used to specify the offset from which the file should be written to. The {\ttfamily -\/n} flag can be used to specify the number of bytes to be written to the file. If the {\ttfamily -\/n} flag is not used, the entire file will be written to. If the {\ttfamily -\/o} flag is not used, the file will be written to from the beginning.

The user is prompted with a message to enter the text to be written to the file. The user can enter the contents of the file. To end the input, the user has to type {\ttfamily \+:w} followed by the {\ttfamily Enter} key.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Writing to a File}\label{index_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ write\ file.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{type\ :w\ to\ exit}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/}
\DoxyCodeLine{lorem\ ipsum\ dolor\ amet}
\DoxyCodeLine{:w}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Copying Files}\label{index_autotoc_md12}
The {\ttfamily copy} command should be used to copy the contents of one file to another using an unnamed pipe. If the destination file exists, the program will force the user to pass the {\ttfamily -\/f} flag to overwrite it.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Copying a File}\label{index_autotoc_md13}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ copy\ file.txt\ file2.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{Copied\ file.txt\ to\ file2.txt...}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{File Information}\label{index_autotoc_md14}
The {\ttfamily info} command should be used to display statistical information about a file. The information displayed includes the file type, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, block size, number of blocks, last access time, last modification time, and last status change time.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{Example\+: Displaying File Information (\+Regular File)}\label{index_autotoc_md15}

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsection{Pipes}\label{index_autotoc_md17}
The {\ttfamily pipe} command should be used to create a pipe and simulate communication between two processes. This program can demonstrate this using both unnamed as well as named pipes.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsubsection{Unnamed Pipes}\label{index_autotoc_md18}
If used with {\ttfamily -\/u} flag, it creates an unnamed pipe. The user is prompted with a message to enter the text to be written to the pipe. The user can enter the contents of the pipe. To end the input, the user has to type {\ttfamily \+:q} followed by the {\ttfamily Enter} key. Internally, the program forks a child process and the parent process writes to the pipe and the child process reads it from the pipe and prints the contents to {\ttfamily stdout}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ pipe\ -\/u}
\DoxyCodeLine{type\ :q\ to\ exit}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/}
\DoxyCodeLine{Message:\ Hello}
\DoxyCodeLine{Received\ from\ Parent:\ Hello}
\DoxyCodeLine{Message:\ :q}
\DoxyCodeLine{Received\ Bye\ from\ Parent...}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsubsection{Named Pipes}\label{index_autotoc_md19}
If a path is specified, it uses a named pipe in the mode (reader or writer) specified by the argument after the path of the pipe. The user is prompted with a message to enter the text to be written to the pipe. The user can enter some text and press {\ttfamily Enter} to send the message. To end the input, the user has to type {\ttfamily \+:q} followed by the {\ttfamily Enter} key. If the pipe already exists, the program will force the user to pass the {\ttfamily -\/f} flag to overwrite it, otherwise, it will attempt to use the existing pipe.

Multiple instances of the program have to be run to demonstrate communication between processes. In case multiple readers are waiting for a writer, the first reader to read from the pipe will receive the message and the rest will receive an empty string. This is because the message is removed from the pipe after it is read. Which reader receives the message is determined by the operating system scheduler.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\ writer\ process}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ pipe\ pipe\ w\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{type\ :q\ to\ exit}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/-\/}
\DoxyCodeLine{Message:\ Hello\ World}
\DoxyCodeLine{Message:\ :q\ }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\ reader\ process}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ ./main\ pipe\ pipe\ r}
\DoxyCodeLine{Waiting\ for\ writer...}
\DoxyCodeLine{Received:\ Hello\ World}
\DoxyCodeLine{Received\ Bye...}
