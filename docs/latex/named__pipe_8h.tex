Uses named pipes for message passing between reader and writer processes. 

If invoked in write mode, the program will create a named pipe at the specified path if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist and write to it. If invoked in read mode, the program will wait for a writer to write to the named pipe and then read from it.

In write mode, the user is prompted to enter a message to write to the named pipe. The user can exit the program by entering {\ttfamily \+:q} as the message.

This function is invoked by the {\ttfamily pipe} command.

In read mode, the program will wait for a writer to write to the named pipe and then read from it. The process will exit when it receives {\ttfamily \+:q} from the writer.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em path} & the path to the named pipe \\
\hline
{\em read\+\_\+flag} & 0 for write mode, 1 for read mode \\
\hline
{\em force\+\_\+flag} & 0 to create a new named pipe, 1 to use an existing named pipe \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
0 on success, -\/1 on failure 
\end{DoxyReturn}
